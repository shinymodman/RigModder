		<h2 class="text-centered">Introduction (Short for now)</h2>

		<p>
			I would like to introduce you to RigModder. This application is made for modding Rigs of Rods content that involve node/beam structures. Right now, it is in the process of being in development. But I put it out there as open source for you guys to try it and see what you think of it.
		</p>

		<p>
			So far, the app looks at the nodes, beams, hydraulics, shocks and soon flares and wheels. With the wheels, I will try my best to make the rendering of the wheels visually correct, since Cairo is only a 2d vector library. To launch the app, look at the 'Download' section for more details.
		</p>
		
		<h3 class="text-centered">What does the app look like?</h3>

		<h2 class="text-centered">What functionality does this app have?</h2>

		<p>
			Just to be clear, this app's interface has differnet functionality. To rotate the X-Axis, you must
			press the left <code>Shift</code> key and hold a mouse button. And move the mouse only left and right. Same as rotating the Z-Axis, but instead press the left <code>Alt</code> key.
		</p>

		<p>
			Although with the Y-Axis. You have to press the <code>Ctrl</code> key and click the left/right mouse button. With moving the mouse, you must move the mouse and cursor up and down.
		</p>

		<p>
			Also, right now, you can select nodes and beams using their respective dialogs. To do this, select the <code>View</code> dropdown menu and select either Nodes or beams. Right now, these pieces of the truckfile are only supported as of this writing. Select one of them and you will see a whole list of content to select. If you double click the selection as shown below, it will change the color for the selected content.
