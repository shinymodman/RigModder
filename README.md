# RigModder Manual
For Rigs of Rods, it edits and maybe visualizes objects attached to nodes. Such as flares.

**NOTE:** This is the branch *ONLY* for editing the app's webpage that contains the downloads and instructions on how to use it.

Only use this if you want to contribute to the webpages rather than the app's code itself.
